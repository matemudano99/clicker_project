# Space Miner 🚀

A simple "idle clicker" game built with Python, based on an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The goal is to mine asteroids, collect crystals, and complete the final mission.

* **Game Goal:** Reach 25,000 crystals to "COMPLETE MISSION".
* **Progress Tracking:** The UI shows total crystals, per-click rate, auto-mining rate, and time played.

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Tkinter**
* **MVC Architecture**

## Project Structure

The project follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate logic from the user interface:

* `Main.py`: The main entry point of the application. It initializes and connects the Model, View, and Controller.
* `GameModel.py`: Contains all the game's data and business logic. It manages the state (e.g., `crystals`, `per_click_value`, `auto_mining_rate`, upgrade costs) and performs all calculations.
* `GameView.py`: Manages the entire graphical user interface (GUI). It builds the window, buttons, and labels, and is responsible for *displaying* the data from the Model.
* `GameController.py`: Acts as the bridge between the Model and the View. It handles all user input (like button clicks) and tells the Model to update its state, or tells the View to update its display.
